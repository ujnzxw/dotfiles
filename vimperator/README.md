Vimperator
==========
Vimperator is a free browser add-on for Firefox,
which makes it look and behave like the Vim text editor.

My configuration file for the
[Vimperator](http://www.vimperator.org/vimperator) Firefox addon, which makes
it look and behave like the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) text editor.

Installation
------------

* Copy `.vimperatorrc` to `$HOME/`.
